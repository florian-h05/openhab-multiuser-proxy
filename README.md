# openHAB Multi-User support for the REST API

This project aims to provide a secure multiuser support for the [openHAB REST API](https://www.openhab.org/docs/configuration/restdocs.html#openhab-rest-api).
It is utilising a NodeJS application and the popular [NGINX](https://www.nginx.com/) webserver to proxy and filter requests to the REST API.
